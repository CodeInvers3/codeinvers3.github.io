## About me

I work as a freelance developer specializing in web application development, with experience setting up and managing Linux-based servers (Ubuntu or similar) using Apache with PHP or Node.js, as well as integrating databases.

I am also expanding my skills into Android development and using the Linux environment for development purposes on programming boards, particularly for controlling peripherals.

In addition to freelance and temporary projects, I pursue personal projects and hobbies in areas such as electronics and console hacking, which help me continuously grow my technical expertise and creativity.
